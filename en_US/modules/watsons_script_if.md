# EMQX & Watsons SDES Script - IF

## Function Explanation
The IF function can be used to determine whether a file exists, in order to make corresponding adjustments in subsequent operations. For example, if a store needs to generate sales reports regularly and upload them to a server, it is necessary to check whether the local report file has been generated before uploading. If the file exists, the upload operation can be executed. Otherwise, an error message may be displayed or the report may be regenerated.
